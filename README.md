## To do & done

> It's the begining of journey.

### Done

- [x] architecture
- [x] inner design
- [x] core
- [x] [additional funcionality](#additional-functionality) which was stimulus for me to make whole app

#### Additional functionality
Long story short: for almost a year I was forking every repository which was interesting for me — then I realized that the reason `fork` exists is slightly different so I wrote a code which lets me `GET` all of my repos names and delete it through `shell script`. 

### To do

- [ ] add HTTP Verbs: `GET/POST/PUT/DELETE`
- [ ] add all GitHubs API methods
- [ ] write CLI documentation like so: `viae --help` will print manual
- [ ] add [npm][npm] package

## Development

> N/A right now.

Clone repository via `git clone` and install all Dependencies in downloaded `viae` root folder — use your favorite package manager.

```zsh
git clone https://github.com/robertgrzonka/viae
cd viae
yarn
```

> Change yarn to `npm install` if you'd like.
